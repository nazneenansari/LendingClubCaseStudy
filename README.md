> This case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, we develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## General Information
  #### Problem Statement
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
 #### Dataset
- Dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011. It contains approved loan data with customer information and customer behaviorial data. There is no transactional history of those applicants whose loan is rejected by the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset).
